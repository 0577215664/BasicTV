  Multiple connections can be made to a single client perfectly fine. However,
  the node you are connecting to will register all of the sockets as individual
  peers. 

  Multiple connections doesn't make much sense unless you want to increase the
  throughput of the Tor network by opening more circuits. SOCKS proxies are 
  somewhat implemented, but the easy creating and destroying of Tor circuits 
  is not (shouldn't be hard).
