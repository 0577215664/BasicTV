  Multiple connections doesn't make much sense unless you want to increase the

  net_request_t: requesting an ID from another peer

  This is one of a few types that is allowed to be sent first, currently the
  only one (another type is a symmetric key system, but that isn't implemented
  yet and isn't really needed right now, let's make that a version 2 network
  thing, possibly).

  If the socket_id is zero, then assume this request is local going out.

  There is no hard-defined upper limit on the list of ids, since a net_request_t
  is P2P, not a network wide datatype.

  If type is blank, and the request type is a blacklist, then don't reply. There
  is no reason to send out literally every piece of information we have.

  If type is blank, and the request type is a whitelist, then fill those as best
  as we can.

  if type is not blank, then fill them properly (whitelist or blacklist works),
  and send them back through the socket_id (non-zero).

  There are soft limits on what types of information can be sent over as all of
  a type:
  net_peer_t, encrypt_pub_key_t, and net_con_req_t are almost always allowed,
  since they are small and few in number (relative to other types)

  tv_channel_t is almost always allowed as well, as it is the seed for the
  linked lists

  tv_frame_*_t types are almost never allowed by a type, since they are so vast
  in number, and the statistical odds of returning 10% useful information is
  vanishingly small

  This is excluding instances where it can't be relayed at all for security
  reasons (encrypt_priv_key_t, namely), or is completely used locally and is
  either generated on the fly or has no use elsewhere (tv_menu_t, tv_window_t,
  net_socket_t/net_proto_socket_t, among others). It can be said that
  ID_DATA_NOEXPORT and ID_DATA_NONET override net_request_t entirely.
