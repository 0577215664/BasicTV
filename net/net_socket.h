/*
  net_socket_t: Manages network sockets. Socket is stored inside of this file. 
  Using torsocks should work with this program, as there are no plans for UDP
  packets whatsoever, and this program isn't doing anything too technical.

  TCP sockets should be able to have multiple chunks of information sent over
  them, but vandals and malicious nodes that mis-represent the data should be
  detected and punished somehow (perhaps have a sanity checker for all values
  built into the ID API, so invalid numbers can be detected?).
  
  TODO: implement multiple Tor circuits at one time. It would be great because
  the decentralized nature works better when multiple TCP streams are being used
  at the same time (to spread information, receiving information won't really
  matter after the ID index is used efficiently).

  IP addresses and port numbers shouldn't exist on their own, but instead in
