The following is not entirely accurate for the current version, but are instead v1.0 goals. However, there is some proof of concept somewhere for everything listed, and is just a matter of implementing it.

# BasicTV
A simple, decentralized Internet television system

##What is it?
BasicTV is "a simple, decentralized Internet television system". You can flip through channels like you would a standard TV. There is no central entity. It also has:
* Programmable IR remote codes: any free code can control your box
* Extensible macros for ease of use
* No bandwidth nor quality restrictions for content
* Support for 3D TV (red and blue)
* Support for multiple different quality audio and video streams for different connections
* Support for multiple different dubbed tracks for different languages
* Support for multiple different closed captions for different languages
* No upper limit for channel count
* Decentralized streaming, meaning the BasicTV network does the heavy lifting
* Decentralized DVR service, infinitely rewind
* All content is exportable to multiple formats (FTP, DVD, BD-R, SSH, etc)
* Easy to operate a channel
* Donate to channels to help support them
* Donate to nodes to incentivize network growth and help prioritize your connection
* Multithreading Tor circuits for fast anonymous downloads
* Have multiple channels visible at the same time with an tmux layout

#How can I get it?
Currently, the only supported OS is Linux. However, the minimum specifications match a Raspberry Pi, so having a dedicated TV box for BasicTV is cheap and practical (OpenBox and a startup script and you should be golden).
