  ir.h: basic input handling for IR sensor. The part is the TSOP38238
  for the Raspberry Pi (but via GPIO, so anything should work). 

  This implements the NEC protocol and does basic error checking, correcting, 	
  and repeat commands. Pretty much everything it should do
  
  I don't think LIRC is the way to go, especially with the programmable 
  aspect of it. Linux drivers exist that can read GPIO pins at 38kHz, so
  I am planning on using that in conjunction with this.
