  Since I am actually using this right now, let's put the cap at 1080p.
  I plan to keep support for insane max resolutions, but I need to make
  a function that pre-allocates large contiguous chunks of memory. Once that
  is done, then this can go back up within reason

  I can also make different subsets of tv_frame_t, one for low quality, one for 
  current HD, and one for 4K streams and above, but that overcomplicates
  a lot of the code. What ought to happen is defining a second type of
  patch that goes inside of the frame array, and is referring to the first
  frame. Conventional patches should still exist for older frames.
