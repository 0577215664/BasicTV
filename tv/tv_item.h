/*
  TV content is in "items", similar to the TV Guide

  A TV item doesn't NEED a list of all of the IDs, since
  permeating multiple different versions of the same content
  doesn't work well on live streams (there is no way to download
  a diff between two versions of an exported ID, so we either have
  to create one large set that doesn't need to be updated or use
  linked lists for live stream data to prevent (as much) redundant
  downloading (redundant downloading may still happen since a linked
  list can have variable forward and backwards lengths) ).

  Also, I am not fond of changing the ID after creation (except in
  bootstrapping cases), so we can't pre-create a list of IDs and fill
  them in properly afterwards (efficient, but complex).

  TODO: Since there is no valid reason for a non-request ID of hash
  A to refer to an ID of hash B, we can create some ID sanity checks
  to prevent piracy and nonsense problems.
