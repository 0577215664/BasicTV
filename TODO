TV system
Change color format from std::tuple to macros with a 64-bit integer (slowly move it over)
	Was working on this the hard way, stuff broke, and I reverted the changes, that's why the
	frame demo was broken for so long. Since the rendering was sped up, this isn't a priority
Enable support for seamless exchanges between tv_frame_t and tv_patch_t IDs
Allow for both edited and unedited clips to be allowed
	Embed a value into a virtual class for tv_frame_t and tv_patch_t for unedited IDs
Implement some sort of closed captioning system?
Implement audio feeds in general?
Implement some different audio feeds for different languages?

ID system
Change entire system to allow for RSA fingerprint planting.
Finish exporting system
Allow for some basic level of lossless compression (before encryption)
Allow for using std::vector<uint8_t> for possibly large (but defined) lengths
      raw frame data for compressed frames drops to zero
Allow for simple garbage collection and disk caching
	Disk caching is one of the major selling points of this (possibly infinite DVR space)
	There is no garbage collection for global variables, but local data types that cannot be networked
	(or shouldn't be networked) should be periodically cached to disk, and the ones who keep wanting them
	read back to them will be put on a whitelist of ones to not cache again (or not as much). This wouldn't
	work too well for random global IDs, but those should be nested in some larger struct and called
	with all_of_type anyways to make it (probably) more extensible

Input system
Implement actual IR code receiving
Allow an easy to use interface for configuring a certain remote to work
Get a basic API for TCP/IP control over the box for an app
	IR is only as terrible as the software it controls
	Sell the phone app on things IR simply cannot do

General
Create a lightweight threadpool
Reach out for support once there is at least some templates for all facets of the codebase
	Inputs, ID requests, exporting, menus, TV channels, DVRing, exporting to other formats, and
	a slew of other work needs to be done, but I think I can knock (most) of that out in a month
	(at least get a template)

Make a legitimate website or web-based interface into the network
	Not really streaming directly to the web browser (I don't know how well web browsers can
	handle that sort of networking, on the fly decoding, and other items), but instead just \
	have a TV Guide setup and channel meta-data


Create some sort of audio interface so there doesn't have to be a screen to use it. Just connect
it to a radio, and use the IR remotes and other controlling systems to create just a radio system
for a full house solution

Create a method of easily controlling local BasicTV nodes, so they can work together in some sort
of surround sound system or something like that (mostly surround sound)
