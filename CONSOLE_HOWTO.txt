TV MANAGER
The TV manager is the only interface into playback and broadcasting to the
network at the moment.

To access the TV manager, open a TCP connection (telnet) to BasicTV, port
59000 (default, changable with --conport) and type tv_manager (after yo
see BasicTV console).

WARNING: tv_manager, as currently implemented, blocks the main thread of
execution. If you want to service data to others, or have a responsive node
for other tasks, please leave when you aren't actively working.

TV Manager has the following commands
	(1) Load TV Item to Channel
	(2) Bind TV Item to Window
	(3) Play Loaded TV Item in 10 Seconds
	(4) Change Item in Window
	(5) List TV Channels, Items, Sinks
	(6) List TV Sinks
	(7) Create a Sink
	(8) Create TV Channel
	(9) Exit TV Manager


LOADING A WAVE FILE
Because of legacy code and simplicity, you can load a WAVE file without
a TV sink.

First, you need to create a TV channel with the metadata about the stream.
Choosing option #8 prompts you for a name, a description, and a wallet set ID
(no proper interface exists for creating wallet sets, so type "NULL").

After running this, you should see a table with a hex-string. This is the UUID
for the tv_channel_t. Copy this.

Now choose #1 to load an item and bind it to a channel, paste that channel ID.
A start time offset doesn't matter if you are the one listening to it, since
you can easily rewind to ten seconds before live, so a value of 0 will work.
Fill out a name and description of the item you wish to broadcast. From this
prompt, you can choose either an audio frame or a numerical frame to bind to
the item (remember, more than one is possible internally, but the telnet
interface is clunky enough with one type). You want to pick audio.

Since there is no sink input possible through audio, we are prompted to load it
directly from a file inside of the console. The WAVE data needs to be encoded
in 16-bit depth, 4800Hz, and mono, as this is the BasicTV-wide standard with
raw audio (altough different formats are widely supported, currently there is
no way to do raw to raw audio conversions for Opus, so we adopted their internal
standards). This can be done with  ffmpeg:
'ffmpeg -i input.wav -ac 1 -ar 48000 -sample_fmt s16 output.wav'
Specify WAVE as the frame format, and the file is loaded into memory as a type.

PLAYING A WAVE FILE

If you are connecting to a formal network, there should be some pre-loaded
frames already there. You need to specify a bootstrap node, or simply run the
connect.sh command in the root of the directory. Let your node run for a minute,
then open tv_manager and choose option #5 to get a breakdown of all data on the
network. Choose an item you like from the list (if there's something there).
If there is nothing there, you should refer to LOADING A WAVE FILE if you want
to listen, and copy the Item ID.

Choose option #3 and enter the Item ID. Choose option #9 to exit the tv_manager,
entering the main loop, and start playback.
