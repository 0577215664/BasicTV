  TODO:
  Get an IR API set up (and a general input API)

  Implement SDL_image in tv.cpp
  Implement SDL_mixer in tv.cpp
  16x2 support? What would I use it for?

  I might be able to piggyback on the RPI_BTC_ATM code for Bitcoin txs,
  but I don't want to force people to run a Bitcoin node on a restrained
  connection (look into libbitcoin, cbitcoin, etc.). I only need a dedicated
  system of transactions for a sponsorship program, so having a QR code show
  up should be enough integration for most people (at the time of writing), 
  not to mention the fact that I don't want people locking away tons of 
  money on inseucre software
