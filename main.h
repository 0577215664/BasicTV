  future network versions MUST be able to read those bits of data
  and be able to operate "normally" (use all of the data sent over
  properly with no bugs or errors). Because of the encryption, there
  is no need to write information to this older standard (assuming
  that most of the network has updated to a new version of the networking
  standard, which shouldn't happen often).

  Types that don't exist yet can be ditched, and the software should
  continue to function properly in all cases.
